Overview
--------

 - A Kotlin application

 - HTTP API server to communicate with Driver

 - WebSocket server for text-based chat and screen markings, and also
   as a signaling server for WebRTC

 - STUN/TURN server for WebRTC

 - Option: Database to store session informations: Session ID,
   text-based chat posts, and screen markings


HTTP API server
---------------

 - POST /api/session/create  Create a session.  Returns the URL that
   Driver should share with their team.

 - DELETE /api/session/{session-id}  Destroy a session.


WebSocket server
----------------

 - Each connection must be authenticated with the session ID

 - Works as the signaling server for WebRTC

 - Option: Text-based chat

 - Option: Screen markings


STUN/TURN server for WebRTC
---------------------------

 - coturn (https://github.com/coturn/coturn)

   * Included in Ubuntu's default package repository.

 - XXX: Do we need TURN?

   * If we need it, do we have to re-generate credentials for each
     session for security?

   * If we don't, maybe Google's public STUN server can be used?
